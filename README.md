### `Frameworks`
I have used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) and [React](https://reactjsexample.com/learninng-react-js-create-forms-with-formik/) 
<br>
I fired powershell with  `npx create-react-app` command to make all the necessary files of react.Then used `npm start` then followed git commands to upload in github.
Copy and paste the commands from here .
```markdown
  npx create-react-app my-app 
  cd my-app
  npm start
```
